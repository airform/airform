> Functional HTML forms for Front-End Developers.


## Why it's awesome

What if you could use a service that gives you full control over the form, yet doesn’t require you to use anything on your server? Airform gives you the ability to create functional HTML forms without thinking about servers.


## Usage

```
<form method="post" action="https://airform.io/your@email.com">
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <button>Send</button>
</form>
```

**Quick Tip:** The `action` attribute defines the location URL where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted. The `method` attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with (should be "post"). All `input`, `select`, `textarea` elements whitin your form should have a `name` attribute.
