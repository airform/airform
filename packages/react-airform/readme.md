> Functional HTML forms for React Developers.

## Why it's awesome

What if you could use a service that gives you full control over the form, yet doesn’t require you to use anything on your server? Airform gives you the ability to create functional HTML forms without thinking about servers.

## Usage

```jsx
import Airform from 'react-airform'

<Airform email="your@email.com">
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <button>Send</button>
</Airform>
```

**Quick Tip:** The `email` attribute defines the email that will receive the form's collected data when it is submitted. The `method` attribute is `post` by default. All `input`, `select`, `textarea` elements whitin your form should have a `name` attribute.
